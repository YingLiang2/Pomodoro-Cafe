## General Info
- This was a group project that was made for the class COMP 3020 Human Computer Interaction 1. It was a semester long group project.
- We create a Pomodoro wbesite, which if you don't know what it is. It is basically a type/style of studying, where you focus for x amount of minutes, and then rest for x another minutes.
  Usually its 50 minutes of pure focus and 10 minutes of break. Then the cyle repeats for how many ever sessions you plan to.
  <br>What we created as a group is a way of stylizing Pomodoro, where we kept the clock as our main focus, but we added themes of a coffee shop, hence the cafe in the name. 
  <br>In our app,
  there is an animation that goes in hand with the timer. Say we have a timer of 50 minutes, our coffee animation will start brewing coffee and once the 50 minutes is up, the coffee will be fully brewed and the pot of coffee will be full, indicating that it is break time.

## Features
- Our website is cafe themed, therefore brown colour theme/style
